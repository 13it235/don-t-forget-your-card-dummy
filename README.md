This project uses vanillaJS(Well... it is pure javascript) only.

#Why there is no package.json
- Because everything here is pure(Just Kidding...)
- This was an interview question which I was not able to complete on time with quality code
- The instructions were no third party libraries to be used which means no npm or any form of package manager needed
- For those who are still wondering, why I did not solve this question at the interview:
    * Because I am bad at pure JS programming as I have majorly used ReactJS and Angular(2-5) only
    * Because I had only 2 hours to even think in Javascript

#Steps to make it work
- Clone the project
- Open the HTML file in your favorite browser 
- Make the change you want (Send me merge request if you like to)

#What is being done
- Working on the CRUD functionality now

#Tasks left (Vague estimate)
- Make the app pretty
- Give it some security 
- Store the info in a database
- Give it more security
