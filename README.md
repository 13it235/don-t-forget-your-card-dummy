This project uses vanillaJS(Well... it is pure javascript) only.

#Why there is no package.json
- Because everything here is pure(Just Kidding...)
- This was an interview question which I was not able to complete on time with quality code
- The instructions were no third party libraries to be uses which means no npm or any form of package manager needed
- For those who are still wondering, why I did not solve this question at the interview:
    * Because I am bad at pure JS programming because I used only ReactJS and Angular
    * Because I had only 2 hours to even think in Javascript

#Steps to make it work

#Tasks left (Vague estimate)
